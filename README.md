# Forza-5-CAR-BUYOUT-Sniper
This script uses image matching (e.g., OpenCV) to create a much faster and more stable macro for purchasing the desired car in the auction house.

Note: This script DOESN'T gaurantee 100% to snipe the car. Due to network and other potential issues, you may run it for nothing or get quite a few cars within a long time.

## Pre-Requirements
1. System Requirements:

    This script only tests well on windows 10 with 1920*1080 (100% scale).

2. Game setting: 
    
    I am using [Hyper-V]("https://github.com/jamesstringerparsec/Easy-GPU-PV"), a GPU Paravirtualization on Windows like virtual box on MacOS. Therefore, HDR setting shows wired here.

    To save energy and gpu cost, strongly suggest to set "VERY LOW" in grahic setting.
